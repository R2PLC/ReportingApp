# ReportingApp
Dora La ReportDora

Creating this app has been an incredibly enjoyable journey. While it's still a work in progress, I drew inspiration from the popular app "Snap, Send & Solve." This project originally stemmed from a mobile devices course where we were tasked with building a practical and impactful mobile application.

The app is built entirely using Flutter, and I must extend my gratitude to my supportive professor and collaborative classmates who have been instrumental in its development. 

The primary objective of this app is to streamline the reporting process for various issues, ranging from accidents to a wide array of problems. The goal is for these reports to be seamlessly transmitted to a centralized database where professionals can take swift action to resolve them. These issues encompass a broad spectrum, including electrical, plumbing, structural, and more.

I am excited about the potential impact this app can have on improving the efficiency of issue resolution and enhancing the overall experience for users. While it's still a work in progress, I hope to someday refine and expand its functionality to make it a valuable tool for addressing a multitude of concerns in a streamlined and user-friendly manner.
